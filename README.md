# Smart_Crop_Planner
A PHP-based web application designed to assist farmers by analyzing crop, soil, and weather data to provide smart crop planning and decision support.


## 🌱 Smart Crop Planner – Authentication & Database Schema

### 📌 Project Description

The **Smart Crop Planner** is a web-based application designed to demonstrate a clean and modular backend structure for **farmer and admin registration and login**. This repository focuses on providing the **database schema and authentication workflow** required for the system to function.

⚠️ **Important Note:**
This repository **does not include any pre-created database, sample data, or login credentials**. It is intentionally kept minimal to allow users to understand and implement the system from scratch.

---

### 🗂️ What This Repository Provides

* SQL scripts to **create required tables** for:

  * Admin registration and login
  * Farmer (user) registration and login
  * Crop information management
  * Weather data storage
  * User search history
* PHP-based backend logic for handling registration and login
* A clean structure suitable for extension and customization

---

### 🛠️ Database & Authentication Setup

* Users must **create their own database** in MySQL
* Provided SQL scripts should be executed to **create the necessary tables**
* **No default users or passwords are included**
* To access the system:

  * First **register** as an Admin or Farmer
  * Then **log in** using the registered credentials

This approach ensures flexibility and avoids hardcoded or insecure login details.

---

### 🔐 Login & Registration Flow

1. Create a MySQL database (for example, `crop`)
2. Execute the provided **CREATE TABLE** SQL scripts
3. Register a new Admin or Farmer through the application
4. Log in using the newly created credentials

---

### 🎓 Intended Use

This project is suitable for:

* Academic mini projects
* Web technology & database labs
* Learning authentication workflows
* Understanding database schema design
* Backend PHP + MySQL practice

---

### 🚀 Scope for Enhancement

* Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
* Role-based access control
* API token–based authentication
* Integration with real-time weather APIs
* Deployment-ready database migrations

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage Guide

Follow the steps below to run the project locally:

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your system:

* PHP (8.x recommended)
* MySQL / MariaDB
* Apache Server (XAMPP / WAMP / LAMP)
* Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

---

### 2️⃣ Project Setup

1. Download or clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Move the project folder to your web server directory:

   * XAMPP → `htdocs/`
   * WAMP → `www/`

3. Start **Apache** and **MySQL** from your server control panel.

---

### 3️⃣ Database Setup

1. Open **phpMyAdmin**
2. Create a new database (for example):

   ```
   crop
   ```
3. Select the created database
4. Open the SQL tab and execute the provided **CREATE TABLE SQL scripts** from the repository

⚠️ No tables are pre-filled with data. Only table structure is created.

---

### 4️⃣ Configure Database Connection

1. Open the database configuration file (e.g., `db.php`)
2. Update the database name, username, and password:

```php
$pdo = new PDO(
    "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=crop;charset=utf8mb4",
    "root",
    ""
);
```

(Adjust credentials based on your local setup.)

---

### 5️⃣ Registration & Login

* The system **does not include default users**
* Users must **register first** using the registration forms
* After successful registration, users can log in using their own credentials

This ensures a clean and realistic authentication workflow.

---

### 6️⃣ Running the Application

1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost/<project-folder-name>/
   ```
3. Register as Admin or Farmer
4. Log in and explore the features

---

### 🧪 Notes

* This project is intended for **local development and learning**
* Password hashing and authentication logic can be extended for production use
* The schema is flexible and can be modified as needed
